Spherical Differential,"At some point I might develop this mechanism into something more useful, however for the time being it only serves as an ornament.  The photos are out of date. Check out the stl of the assembled parts for the most up to date visualisation. I'm using four 3x10 screws to hold the frame together and one 3x20 to hold the two halves of the core together. If you have a dual extruder you might like to check out this alternative design for the gears: Gears - Candy Cane Remix Print Settings: Printer: Ultimaker 2 Supports: Yes Resolution: 0.4 nozzle __ 0.2 mm layer thickness Infill: 20% Notes: IMPORTANT! READ THIS The bottom part of the the gears are rather fiddly as only the very tips of the teeth make contact with the build plate. For this reason i have build a supplementary support structure into the stl file itself (see JPG). You will obviously still need slicer generated support structures for all other overhangs, use ""touching build plate"" rather than ""everywhere"". For the gears I would also strongly recommend using a ""brim"" to get better contact with the build plate.",https://pinshape.com/items/31056-3d-printed-spherical-differential,//assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124779/pin_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124779.jpg,['3D-Design'],"[['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124779/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124779.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124779/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124779.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124780/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124780.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124780/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124780.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124781/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124781.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124781/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124781.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124782/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124782.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124782/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124782.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124783/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124783.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124783/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124783.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124784/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124784.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124784/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124784.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124785/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124785.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124785/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124785.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124786/container_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124786.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/124786/horizontal_thumbnail_spherical-differential-3d-printing-124786.jpg']]",Free

Spiral Chess Set (Large),"A spiral themed chess set that can be printed without supports. I modeled and rendered this using SolidWorks. Any criticism is welcome and appreciated. This has been a project I have been working on since I first got my printer. I wanted to develop something that could not be manufactured by any other process other than 3D Printing. I also wanted to make sure that the design was possible to print without the help of supports, as I have found that do not have the patience to deal with them. The most challenging piece to design was definitely the Knight, but I am quite happy with how they all turned out! The pieces are quite large, so I suggest printing at ~75% scale for most boards. I printed my pieces on a Makerfarm 8"" Prusa i3v in PLA @ 0.2mm layer height. Each piece took a while but it was definitely worth the effort. Enjoy!",https://pinshape.com/items/5518-3d-printed-spiral-chess-set-large,//assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21146/pin_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21146.jpg,"['pinshape-support-free-design-contest', 'chess', 'spiral-chess', 'spiral', 'chess-set', 'games', 'boardgame']","[['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21146/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21146.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21146/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21146.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21143/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21143.JPG', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21143/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21143.JPG'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21144/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21144.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21144/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21144.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21145/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21145.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21145/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21145.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21147/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21147.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21147/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21147.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21148/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21148.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21148/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21148.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21149/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21149.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21149/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21149.jpg'], ['https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21150/container_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21150.jpg', 'https://assets.pinshape.com/uploads/image/file/21150/horizontal_thumbnail_spiral-chess-set-large-3d-printing-21150.jpg']]",Free
Fully assembled 3D printable wrench,"After watching the infamous video from a few years back where Z-Corp prints a fully working wrench i decided i wanted to do the same thing on my own printer. Now, i am not talking about a ""print-several-pieces-and-then-assemble"" version which there are already a ton of on the internet. What i wanted to do was something i could print and that would actually be fully working straight out of the printer. I like to think i came pretty close. All you need to do is to remove the internal support and your done! Keep in mind this is a proof of concept, i just wanted to see if i could do it. Updated 2013-10-16: Added ""Printable Wrench W Longer Screw"" which has a longer ""screw"" (3mm). Updated 2013-08-30: I have added two new files. One with a slightly bigger gap between moving parts. This one has 0,55mm gap instead of 0,35mm. Let me know if it works out (in particular with PLA). I have also added a STEP file with no support for anyone who might want it.
